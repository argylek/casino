NOTES:

I highly recommend that once you complete a game in the casino go back through all of the code as a group
and refactor it. Look for any code that is not DRY (Don't repeat yourself) and move it into common methods.
Look for things that can be used in variables etc... If you have any questions about refactoring please 
find any of the TA's or me and we can assist you with it!
